# PyROOT_bindings
* PyROOT, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. 
* This way, it allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus the “glue-ing” of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or applications that provide Python bindings.
* Further, PyROOT can be loaded into the Cling interpreter to allow (as of now still rudimentary) access to Python classes.
* To enable the PyROOT command, the user should make sure that the python command is the one of the installation that has been used to build the PyROOT extension module.
* With Python version >=2.2
